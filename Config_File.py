##Trade All Coins if True, can also specify a list of coins to trade instead. Example: symbol = ['ETHUSDT','BTCUSDT'] & set Trade_All_Coins = False
Trade_All_Coins = False
symbol = ['AAVEUSDT', 'APEUSDT', 'API3USDT', 'AUDIOUSDT', 'AVAXUSDT', 'AXSUSDT', 'BAKEUSDT', 'DYDXUSDT', 'ENSUSDT', 'LITUSDT', 'NEARUSDT', 'RAYUSDT', 'PEOPLEUSDT', 'RUNEUSDT']  ## If Trade_All_Coins is False then we list the coins we want to trade here, otherwise the bot will automatically get all coins and trade them

###################### Coins Traded ##############################################
##Trade All Coins if True, can also specify a list of coins to trade instead. Example: symbol = ['ETHUSDT','BTCUSDT'] & set Trade_All_Coins = False
Trade_All_Coins = True
symbol = ['GMTUSDT']  ## If Trade_All_Coins is False then we list the coins we want to trade here, otherwise the bot will automatically get all coins and trade them

## If you are getting a rate limit error on startup this will add a delay for downloading candlesticks to start
RATE_LIMIT_WAIT = False ## It will not slow down the bot, it will only slow down the startup by about (4 x (number of coins you're trading)) seconds
